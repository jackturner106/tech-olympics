A stock is currently trading at $100. 
You are a market maker and must quote both a bid (buy) 
and an ask (sell) price. If your goal is to make a profit 
from the spread while minimizing risk, how would you set your 
bid and ask prices?

To profit off the spread you would want to quote a bid price below $100 and an ask price above $100.
In order to manage the risk from this trade, we would need to consider the volatility of the asset
at the moment. If the volatility is high, we will need to have a wider gap between our bid and ask
price. This could result in fewer trades being executed but less risk. If volatility is low we can quote
a smaller spread between our bid and ask price.
